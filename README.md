# **Privacy Design Landscape for Central Bank Digital Currencies**

Project funded by the Contributions Program, Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, 2021-2022.

There are many technical complexities involved in designing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) but one of the most complicated of the design parameters is privacy. 

This project does not take a normative position that a CBDC ought to be deployed in a modern economy. Rather, it takes the position that CBDCs are a possibility. The project affirms that privacy must be a starting point for designing a CBDC, not an afterthought.
